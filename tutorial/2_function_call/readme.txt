This example scen is basically the same as in the previous chapter,
except it now contains a new function:

randomizeObjectColor()

This function can be called from the developer console in the browser. Try it!
Open the html file, then open the console (in Firefox and Chrome you do this by hitting Ctrl+Shift+i),
type randomizeObjectColor() and hit enter.

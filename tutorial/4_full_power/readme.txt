Having a websocket client that just listens and executes whatever comes in doesn't just allow us
to call this little function that we defined. It allows us to do anything that we could also do from
the browser console or inside the html/js file. In this example, the html file only loads the
three.js library, starts the websocket executer and the rest comes in from the server.

Using this method you have full remote controll over the document in the browser and you can do
anything your html/js skills allow you to.

Now we want to allow some interaction. We create a button and when the user clicks it, a message
is sent to the server. The server then sends a message back, triggering a call to the
randomizeObjectColor() function. This message is now a simple "click" string but of course you can
also send JSON messages to the server and interpret them there.

BroVi is basically an elaborate wrapper around three.js. Three.js is a 3d engine for the browser,
built on the WebGL technology. How to create a basic scene using three.js can be found here:

https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene

Three.js itself is just a single js file that can be downloaded here:

https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/build

or you can directly link to a web version of three.js in your html file like so:

<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r118/three.min.js"></script>

but then the computer of the person viewing your 3d html files must have internet access.

In this folder you find the scene from the tutorial but pimped a little.

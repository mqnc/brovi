<h1>BroVi - API Documentation</h1>

<p>This documentation covers all the functionality of BroVi and the WebSocket Remote Procedure Call Bridge. You finde the files in the brovi directory.</p>

<details><summary>Brovi.js</summary><div>
	<p>This list documents the core functionality of Brovi (without WebSocket bridge)</p>

	<details><summary>Brovi(root)</summary><div>
		<p>This is the constructor of the Brovi class. All further functions are methods of the created object.</p>
		<u>Parameters:</u>
		<p>
			<b>root</b> is the path of the brovi directory in relation to the html document, needed so brovi knows where to look for files like fonts. (default: "./brovi")</p>
		<u>Examples:</u>
		<p>
			var myBrovi = new Brovi("./libs/brovi")
		</p>
	</div></details>

	<details><summary>get(obj)</summary><div>
		<p>This function finds an object by its name and returns it. It is used internally by BroVi so you can refer to objects by name but you can also call it from inside your own JavaScript script. It doesn't make sense through the RPC bridge though.</p>
		<u>Parameters:</u>
		<p>
			<b>obj</b> has to be the name of an object that was created before.
		</p>
		<u>Examples:</u>
		<p>

	<details><summary>text(options)</summary><div>
		<p>Create a text label. Note: The meshed text is still a bit buggy. Try what works. Also note that if you just open an html file from your disk in your browser, you will run into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">CORS</a> issue when trying to create a meshed text label because it needs to load a font file.

				<b>color</b> can be an array of rgb values between 0.0 and 1.0 or an <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp">html color name</a>. (default: "black")

<details><summary>Generic Remote Control - WsRpcBridge.js</summary><div>
	<p>This bridge is a module that does not depend on Brovi and it can also be used in other projects.</p>

	<details><summary>Bridge Functions</summary><div>

		<details><summary>WsRpcBridge(server, namespace, allowEval, logging)</summary><div>
			<p>This is the constructor of the WsRpcBridge. Once an object is created, it will continuously try to connect with the server. It will also try to reconnect when the connection is broken.</p>
			<u>Parameters:</u>
			<p>
				<b>server</b> is the address of the WebSocket server of your application that the bridge connects to. (default: "ws://localhost:8000")<br>
				<b>namespace</b> is an object that contains all the methods that can be called as functions by the bridge. (default: the WsRpcBridge object itself)<br>
				<b>allowEval</b> defines whether the bridge is allowed to call the eval function on messages (which gives a lot more control, makes the message format easier but should be avoided, they say). (default: false)<br>
				<b>logging</b> defines whether all incoming and outgoing traffic is logged in the web console. (default: false)
			</p>
			<u>Examples:</u>
			<p>
				var myBridge = new WsRpcBridge("ws://localhost:9000", myLib, true, false)
			</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>unwrap(obj)</summary><div>
			<p>Natively, JSON does not support function calls with a syntax like myFun(args). To support this syntax, you need to run the bridge with allowEval set to true. However, calls can also be wrapped into JSON format and that looks like this:</p>
			<p>{"type":"call", "name":"myFun", "args":[arg1, arg2, arg3, ...]}</p>
			<p>(if the function has no arguments, still make sure to pass "args":[])</p>
			<p>In order to distinguish this from a JSON object, all JSON objects also need to be wrapped:</p>
			<p>{"type":"obj", "value":originalObject}</p>
			<p>And we can also perform a variable lookup in the bridge namespace:</p>
			<p>{"type":"var", "name":"myVar"}</p>
			<p>All other kinds of data (bools, numbers, strings, arrays) are just passed through. However, if an array contains objects as elements, they also need to be wrapped.</p>
			<p>The bridge recursively calls this unwrap function on all incoming traffic (that does not start with <b>eval:</b>) so it is important that everything is wrapped accordingly.</p>
			<u>Examples:</u>
			<p>Let's say you want the bridge to execute the following command:</p>
			<p>frobnicate(0, "1", [2, 3], {"four":4, "five":5}, myVar6, myFun(7))</p>
			<p>Be sure that the methods "frobnicate" and "myFun" and the field "myVar6" are available in the bridge's namespace object. Then you can either have allowEval set to true and send:</p>
			<p>eval:frobnicate(0, "1", [2, 3], {"four":4, "five:5}, myVar6, myFun(7))</p>
			<p>or you wrap it into:</p>
			<pre>
{
	"type":"call",
	"name":"frobnicate",
	"args":[
		0,
		"1",
		[2, 3],
		{
			"type":"obj",
			"value":{"four":4, "five":5}
		},
		{
			"type":"var",
			"name":"myVar6"
		},
		{
			"type":"call",
			"name":"myFun"
			"args":[7]
		}
	]
}
			</pre>
			<p>If frobnicate returns a value that you need, you have to send this object as data payload of an rpc message (see Message Types) and if you just want to call it, you have to send it as a cmd (see Message Types).</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>send(obj)</summary><div>
			<p>Sends an object as a JSON string to the server. Note that this object does not need to be wrapped in a way that the unwrap() function understands, it is just sent to your WebSocket server as it is.</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>event(evt, data)</summary><div>
			<p>Sends a JSON object as a string with the following structure:<br><br>
			{"id":-1, "type":"evt", "evt":evt, "data":JSON.stringify(data)}</p>
			<p>
				<b>evt</b> is intended as an event identifier string, e.g. "mousedown".<br>
				<b>data</b> is an object containing all the payload data for the event.
			</p>
		</div></details>

	</div></details>


	<details><summary>Message Types</summary><div>
		<p>All communication traffic is sent and received in text format. The following messages are understood and sent:</p>

		<details><summary>eval</summary><div>
			<p>If you set allowEval to true during bridge construction, the server can send the following message to the bridge:</p>
			<p>eval:console.log("Full eval power!")</p>
			<p>The first 5 letters must be lowercase "eval" followed by a colon, this part will be truncated from the string and the eval function is called on the rest of it, effectively executing the string as if it was written in a .js file or entered via developer console.</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>cmd</summary><div>
			<p>This is a command that does not expect an answer and it has to come in in the following format:</p>
			<p>{"type":"cmd", "data":data}</p>
			<p>The bridge will just unwrap the data. Please refer to the unwrap() function in the Bridge Functions section in order to understand how to wrap the data.</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>asgn</summary><div>
			<p>This is an assignment. The bridge will create a variable with this name in its namespace. The message has to come in in the following format:</p>
			<p>{"type":"asgn", "var":varname, "data":data}</p>
			<p>The bridge will unwrap the data and assign it to the variable. Please refer to the unwrap() function in the Bridge Functions section in order to understand how to wrap the data.</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>rpc</summary><div>
			<p>This is a remote procedure call that will be answered and it has to come in in the following format:</p>
			<p>{"type":"rpc", "id":id, "data":data}</p>
			<p>The bridge will unwrap the data and answer with the following message:</p>
			<p>{"type":"ans", "id":id, unwrap(data)}</p>
			<p>The id is used so you can match the answer to call. If unwrapping the data returns a value, it is sent back. Please refer to the unwrap() function in the Bridge Functions section in order to understand how to wrap the data.</p>

<details><summary>BroVi Through The Bridge - index.html</summary><div>
	<p>This html file creates an instance of BroVi and extends it so it can communicate with an outside application through a WebSocket Remote Procedure Call bridge.</p>

	<details><summary>BroVi Extensions</summary><div>
		<p>These methods are appended to the Brovi class and are accessible just like Brovi's native methods.</p>

		<details><summary>refresh()</summary><div>
			<p>This function refreshes the browser window.</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>ping()</summary><div>
			<p>This function just returns "pong". It can be used to measure the delay through the rpc bridge or it can be called synchronously to make your application wait for the browser to catch up.</p>
		</div></details>

		<details><summary>reflect()</summary><div>
			<p>This function returns a list of all functions and variables that brovi provides. If you are working in a dynamic programming language, you can then make those functions available in the global namespace.</p>
		</div></details>

	</div></details>


	<details><summary>Built-in Events</summary><div>
